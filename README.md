## Description

Fake news, that is false or misleading information disguising as legitimate news, poses a serious threat by influencing public opinion and spreading misinformation. In this context, fake news detection has become an urgent task for mitigating the societal harms caused by misinformation, especially in political contexts. This study investigates which textual characteristics are most predictive of fake news by comparing three different types of text representations: world-level features (TF-IDF), linguistic stylistic features (such as punctuation and sentence structure), and deep contextual embeddings (BERT). Our dataset contains approximately 21,500 fake and 21,000 true news articles which allows us to evaluate and compare models in terms of accuracy and precision. All models tested attain high accuracy within the dataset (over 90\%), with BERT slightly outperforming the two other models. Our findings suggest that writing style alone can be highly predictive, highlighting the importance of both lexical and linguistic signals in fake news detection.
